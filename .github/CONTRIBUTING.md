## Purpose of this project

This project is a sandbox to try new technology. In the past, this project tried Kotlin, jlink, GraalVM native image, Kotlin-based Gradle buildscript, Java Flow, Serverless Framework, Selenide, Codacy, New Relic, Heroku, [Hacobune](https://manual.c1.hacobuneapp.com/docs), and more technologies.

To realize this purpose, this project keeps itself easy-to-change. In most cases it is not so important to keep interfaces same.
